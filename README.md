# Simple-captcha-decoder
A very simple python script that can decode primitive captchas using the tesseract ocr engine.

First to install Tesseract, run
	sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
	
Then use python2 to run this script passing captcha filenames as command line arguments.

Note: Tesseract only works well for primitive captchas
